fork and clone this repo beforehand:

**** my laptop broke down completely SUnday and I just got and am currenly using a pretty old and severely outdated laptop that is 
giving me issues cloning the repo (surprisingly forking was easy enough though) my code was backed up beforehand but it may not be
all "there" because testing was troublesome.
